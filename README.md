# Specify

Specify parses test specifications written in Gherkin format and runs them via RSpec.

The goal of Specify is to separate the concepts behind tools like Cucumber and Lucid from their implementation. The latter has been weak in some cases but the former has been strong.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'specify'
```

And then execute:

## Usage

Further details on usage will be coming as Specify evolves.
